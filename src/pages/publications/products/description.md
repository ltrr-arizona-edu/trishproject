TRISH publication collection includes a variety of publications
that led to the development of RIMS platform, climate-sensitive
tree-ring networks across the Yenisei River Basin, and
ultimately to the TRISH online tool. In addition to that you
would find links to download the latest papers resulted from
this research project. The publications are organized by the
topics and the year of publishing.
