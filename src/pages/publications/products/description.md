The TRISH publication collection includes a variety of publications
that led to the development of the RIMS platform, climate-sensitive
tree-ring networks across the Yenisei River Basin, and
ultimately to the TRISH online tool. In addition, you
will find links to download the latest papers resulting from
this research project. The publications are organized by
topics and year of publishing.
