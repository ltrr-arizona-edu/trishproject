I apply tree-ring data to study the variability of streamflow, precipitation and snowpack on timescales longer than the instrumental period.Â  Past projects include multi-century reconstruction of streamflow for small and large basins across the western USA. A particular interest is the statistical methodology of identifying hydrologic signals in tree-ring data.
