I am a physical geographer and dendrochronologist researching issues related to climate change and the impact of environmental change on society. My particular interests revolve around the application of tree-ring proxies for climate modeling relevant to water resources, droughts, forests, and societal sustainability. Chronology of the coupled human-natural systems is my other interest. Geography of projects: Northern Eurasia, Central Asia, and US Great Lakes region.
