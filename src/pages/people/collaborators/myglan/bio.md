I am a historian and dendroarchaeologist. For over a decade, I have been developing the tree-ring network of historical timbers to date historical and archaeological timbers from Ural and Siberia regions. This network addresses the chronology of Eurasian history and helps to crossdate calendar ages of historical objects.
