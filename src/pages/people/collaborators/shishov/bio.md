I am a mathematician with broad interests in forest ecology and climatology. My research focuses on application of time series statistics to tree-ring research. Most recent projects involve experimental and theoretical analysis of the tree-ring width growth in Northern Eurasia (Siberia and China). Currently I work on a process-based model to help us parameterize the ring growth forward and understand radial tree growth.
