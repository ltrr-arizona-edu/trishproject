The Yenisei River (see map below) is the world’s
sixth-largest river in terms of mean annual discharge (585
km³/yr) with the drain area of 2.44 million km² located on the
Central Siberian Plateau. The Yenisei is the most highly
developed of the great Siberian rivers that drain into the Arctic
Ocean. Although the population is only a bit over 5 million people,
the Yenisei River Basin (YRB) has seven reservoirs with operational 
capacity greater than 1 km³ and the total storage capacity of 482 km³. 
The YRB is located mostly in Russia but includes parts of Mongolia 
via the Selenga River. The climate of the YRB is subarctic in the north
and strongly continental in the central parts and south. July's
average temperature ranges from 46 °F (7.8 °C) in the north to 68 °F 
(20 °C) in the south. On the hottest summer days, the temperature can reach
105°F (40.6 °C). January average temperature ranges from −25 °F (-31.7 °C)
in the north to −4 °F (-20 °C) in the south. Annual precipitation in the YRB
averages 16 to 20 inches (40 to 50 cm) in the north, 20 to more than 30
inches (50 to more than 75 cm) in the central portion, and up to 47 inches 
(199 cm) in the high mountains in the south. Annual precipitation varies 
strongly with topography. Closed depressions in the upper part of the
basin can receive less than 8–12 inches (20-30 cm) annually. For the 
basin as a whole, most of the precipitation falls in the warm months
of the year. The cold temperature regime of the YRB has
important consequences for the hydroclimate. An appreciable
fraction of the annual discharge at the mouth of the Yenisei
comes from snowmelt. Ice jams and the associated flooding occur
each year. Continuous permafrost is present over about 1/3 of
the basin, while 89% of the basin experiences permafrost of
some type. The complexity of hydroclimatic conditions across
the YRB and the extensive network of hydrological dams are both the 
curse and cure for hydrological modeling with tree rings. Diverse
climatic signals in the ring growth variability provide a wealth
of information through which we can screen large networks of
tree-ring proxies for optimal reconstruction of discharge
fields.
