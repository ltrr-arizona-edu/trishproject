The map below shows the VS-Lite network sites and locations of fall 1999
field collections. The 30 sites culled for our initial network
of total-width chronologies and extended by the VS-Lite process-based
growth model (Tolwinski-Ward _et al._, 2011) are shown as magenta
triangles. Locations of 19 new sites from the 1999 field trip
are shown as open magenta circles. Some circles represent
multiple closely spaced sites. The 30 VS-Lite sites also
comprise a pilot network we are using for developing
reconstruction software. All VS-Lite sites in this network have
coverage back to at least 1750, and the latest year in all chronologies was
extended to 2019 with VS-Lite. Chronologies
were developed with a uniform setting for detrending and other
operations using program ARSTAN (Cook _et al._, 2007).
