Map showing locations of the 240 tree-ring sites in the Yenisei
River Basin database. Total-width chronologies are available for
all sites. Sub-annual width and maximum density measurements are
available for subsets of these 240 sites. We now have
total-ring-width measurements for 234 of the sites. These were
quality controlled to derive two networks of total-width
chronologies:
a) 165 higher quality sites with uniform coverage 1799-1988 and earliest data in 900 CE, and
b) 30 sites specially selected for wide spacing, good sample depth, and strong common signal.
The 30 site network is shown on the map in Figure 2.
