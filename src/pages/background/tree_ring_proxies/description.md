Heat transported by the Yenisei River depends on both water
temperature and river discharge. The heat flux dominated by
summer discharge (May-Oct) has a volume peak in June, and a heat
peak in June and August. Tree-ring growth responds to the
weather conditions within these seasonal windows, which is most
important to the Yenisei heat transport.

In fall 2019 we update temperature-sensitive tree-ring
chronologies of the Northern Eurasia at the lower reaches of the
Yenisei River and precipitation-sensitive tree-ring chronologies
at the south part of the Yenisei River basin. These proxies are
essential to both discharge and heat flow reconstructions.
