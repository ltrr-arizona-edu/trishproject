Finding the right data for a research project is challenging and
time-consuming task, especially for data users who may explore
new types of data sets outside of their own disciplines and for
people searching across disciplines.

TRISH project develops a data repository and modeling tool for
hydrological observations and tree rings (this type of climate
proxy for now) for everyone's use. The tool incorporates 1)
uniform interfaces for data access that look familiar and 2)
a visualization kit to plot and map the archived series before
downloading or modeling. We also intend to provide data
that meet usersâ€™ research or application requirements with
respect to the data format, projection, model grid,
spatiotemporal resolution and etc.

At this early stage of the TRISH development, we encourage
interdisciplinary cooperation for online archiving,
visualization, and analysis to make the analytic experience of
future users more comprehensive and productive.

Share with us your thoughts about data format, positive or
negative experience working with online data tools, or desirable
datasets for research on Arctic Amplification and climate change.
