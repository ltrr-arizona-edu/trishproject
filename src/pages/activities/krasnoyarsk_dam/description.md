`youtube: [Large flow over the dam spillway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLUbJJRg0I4)`

Video taken June 11, 2021. The spillway at the Krasnoyarsk dam (Hight 124 m or 407 ft, Length 1,065 m or 3,494 ft) has been in operation for almost one month. Extremely excessive flow of the upstream Yenisei River poses flooding hazard to major cities of Krasnoyarsk province and threatens operation of large hydropower stations. As the climate warms and the hydrology of the Arctic changes it will become even more important to understand how frequent events such as these have been historically.
