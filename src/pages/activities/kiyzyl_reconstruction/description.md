The Yenisei River is the largest contributor of freshwater and energy fluxes among all rivers draining to the Arctic Ocean. Changes to the hydrology of the Yenisei Basin have implications for Artic Amplification and global climate, but a sparse network of discharge gauges makes it difficult to understand long-term variability. In a recently published study, we used a network of tree ring chronologies to reconstruct annual and winter discharge at the Kiyzyl gauge, revealing the last 25 years have seen an 80% upsurge in winter flow that is unprecedented in the last 214 years. We suggest these changes may be related to accelerated warming of the permafrost in the discontinuous zone of South Siberia and widespread forest fires.
